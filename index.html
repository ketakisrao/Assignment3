        <h3>1C: Guess Deaths by Motor Vehicle by age</h3>
        <p>For deaths by Motor Vehicle Accident, I think the number of deaths for teenagers
            should be pretty high and it decreases from there to about age 50
            and increases again with age till 75 and then there are not too many deaths post this age.</p>

        <h3>1F: Comparison: Deaths by Motor Vehicle by age</h3>
        <p>I thought that the motor vehicle accidents would almost be close to 0 after crossing the age of 75, it was
            surprising to see that the trend gradually decreases over age till the very end. Maybe I did not take into
            consideration the number of pedestrian deaths caused by Motor Vehicle Accidents or even the deaths caused
            when old people are not the drivers but are passengers, for example in a taxi. Atleast I did manage to
            anticipate
            the increase in number of teen accidents.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>1D: Guess Deaths by Drug Use</h3>
        <p>For deaths by Drug Use, I think the number of deaths for early twenties to the age of 40 should be pretty
            high post which it declines sharply(because death by drugs could only be caused due to an overdose of
            medication or
            relapse of ailments both of which, according to me, are rare)</p>

        <h3>1F: Comparison: Deaths by Drug Use</h3>
        <p>Well, I certainly did not think/know that people above the age of 40 also indulge in drugs and die because of
            drug use, I only thought younger people are more susceptible to drug use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>1F: Takeaway</h3>
        <p>The writing down of how I thought about a certain category of deaths before I saw the actual data helped me
            figure out the assumptions I make/have about the topic(causes of deaths in this case). Data might not always
            support what you think and there is always more to learn from it. </p>
