        <h3>1C: Guess Deaths by Motor Vehicle by age</h3>
        <p>For deaths by Motor Vehicle Accident, I think the number of deaths for teenagers
            should be pretty high and it decreases from there to about age 50
            and increases again with age till 75 and then there are not too many deaths post this age.</p>

        <h3>1F: Comparison: Deaths by Motor Vehicle by age</h3>
        <p>I thought that the motor vehicle accidents would almost be close to 0 after crossing the age of 75, it was
            surprising to see that the trend gradually decreases over age till the very end. Maybe I did not take into
            consideration the number of pedestrian deaths caused by Motor Vehicle Accidents or even the deaths caused
            when old people are not the drivers but are passengers, for example in a taxi. Atleast I did manage to
            anticipate
            the increase in number of teen accidents.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>1D: Guess Deaths by Drug Use</h3>
        <p>For deaths by Drug Use, I think the number of deaths for early twenties to the age of 40 should be pretty
            high post which it declines sharply(because death by drugs could only be caused due to an overdose of
            medication or
            relapse of ailments both of which, according to me, are rare)</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>1F: Comparison: Deaths by Drug Use</h3>
        <p>Well, I certainly did not think/know that people above the age of 40 also indulge in drugs and die because of
            drug use, I only thought younger people are more susceptible to drug use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>1F: Takeaway</h3>
        <p>The writing down of how I thought about a certain category of deaths before I saw the actual data helped me
            figure out the assumptions I make/have about the topic(causes of deaths in this case). Data might not always
            support what you think and there is always more to learn from it. </p>

            Design Choices for the above chart:
            <ul class="box">
                <li>The chart above groups the four causes of deaths: 1) Heart Disease, 2) Cancer, 3) Drug Use, and
                    4) Motor Vehicle Accident.</li>
                <li>Each class is represented with its own color, denoted by the legend to the right,
                    to make it easier for the user to map a particular color to a cause of death and quickly compare it
                    with the
                    adjacent bars without having to look at a label below or to the sides.</li>
                <li>The bars are arranged in increasing
                    order of age (bins). There are labels present just in case the user finds it hard to distiguish
                    between two
                    colors(maybe they're color blind).
                </li>
                <li>These bars are grouped together to represent one age bin and there is
                    enough space between two groups for the user to be able to distinguish between two adjacent groups.
                </li>

        <h3>2E: Bin-ing of data</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Age: </b>could be binned into Children(age &lt; 18), Adults(age &lt; 60) and Senior Citizens(age
                    &gt; 60) to be able to better observe the trends in causes of death.</li>
                <li><b>Sex: </b>can't be binned anymore since it's a small category. I would definitelt add more options
                    to make the application more inclusive.</li>
                <li><b>Race: </b>could be grouped by continents/broader race groups like American Indian, Asian, African
                    American etc, and Asian could have several sub-categories like Chinese, Indian, Korean. This kind of
                    indexing would make it a lot easier to search for a particular ethnicity</li>
                <li><b>Education: </b> This field is already binned and cannot be binned further.</li>
                <li><b>Month_of_death: </b>This field could be binned on the basis of seasons since the each season has
                    distinct weather that could impact the cause of death.</li>
                <li><b>Day_of_week_of_death: </b> Could be binned into weekday or weekend since most people work on
                    weekdays and be at home on weekends which could corelate with accidental/non-accidental causes of
                    death.</li>
                <li><b>Relationship_status: </b>This field cannot be binned further.</li>
                <li><b>Cause: </b>Could be binned into similar causes or similar group of disease.</li>
                <li><b>Group: </b> Groups like 'Asthma', 'Respiratory Condition' and 'Issues breathing' could be binned
                    into one common group 'Breathing Issues' (which is also easier to understand) for better
                    understanding of the cause of death for users.</li>
